## Who is Gheorghe Zamfir?
  
Gheorghe Zamfir was born on April 6, 1941, in GÄeÈti, Romania. He started playing music at a young age, learning to play gypsy songs on the accordion while tending his family's goat pasture[^5^]. At 14, he enrolled at the Bucharest Academy of Music, where he switched to the pan flute under the influence of instructor Fanica Luca[^6^]. He expanded the traditional Romanian-style 20-piped pan flute to 22, 25, 28 and 30 pipes to increase its range, and obtained as many as nine tones from each pipe by changing his embouchure[^5^]. He is known for playing an expanded version of normally 20-pipe nai, with 22, 25, 28 or even 30 pipes, to increase its range, and obtaining as many as eight overtones (additional to the fundamental tone) from each pipe by changing his embouchure[^5^].
  
Zamfir came to the public eye when he was approached by Swiss ethnomusicologist Marcel Cellier, who extensively researched Romanian folk music in the 1960s[^5^]. The composer Vladimir Cosma brought Zamfir with his pan flute to Western European countries for the first time in 1972 as the soloist in Cosma's original music for the movie Le grand blond avec une chaussure noire[^5^]. The movie received several awards, including the Top Foreign Film from the National Board of Review in 1973[^5^]. Zamfir continued to perform as a soloist in movie soundtracks by composers Francis Lai, Ennio Morricone and many others. Largely through television commercials where he was billed as "Zamfir, Master of the Pan Flute", he introduced the folk instrument to a modern audience and revived it from obscurity[^5^].
  
Zamfir has sold over 120 million records worldwide and won 120 gold and platinum disc awards[^6^]. He has performed at prestigious venues such as Carnegie Hall, New York[^6^], and has collaborated with artists such as Nana Mouskouri, James Last, Harry van Hoof, Vangelis and Ennio Morricone. He has also written an autobiography, a book on pan flute technique, and several compositions for pan flute and orchestra[^6^]. He currently resides and teaches panpipe in Bucharest, Romania[^6^].
